# 📊 Students Adaptability EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis on a real-world dataset to understand how different factors influence students' adaptability levels.
This project focuses on discovering patterns related to **education level, institution type, gender, age, and financial condition** using Python.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes the *Students Adaptability Dataset* using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.

The goal is to understand how different demographic and academic features contribute to the adaptability level of students in various learning environments.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Clean and preprocess the dataset
* Encode categorical variables
* Visualize distributions and relationships
* Identify patterns and insights using EDA techniques
* Generate plots for presentation and reporting

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**

---

## 📁 Files Included

* `students_adaptability_.csv` — Dataset
* `eda_script.py` or `.ipynb` — Full code for analysis
* `adaptivity_level.png`
* `gender_age.png`
* `age_gender.png`
* `age_financial.png`
* `edu_adaptivity_scatter.png`
* `edu_adaptivity_bar.png`
* `institution_adaptivity.png`
* `edu_adaptivity_gender_line.png`

(These images are automatically saved by your script.)

## 📌 Key Steps Performed

### **1️⃣ Data Cleaning**

* Checked for missing values
* Verified datatypes
* Mapped categorical columns to numeric values

### **2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis**

Created the following visualizations:

* Distribution of Adaptivity Levels
* Gender distribution by age
* Age distribution by gender
* Financial condition comparison across age groups
* Scatter plots for education vs. adaptivity
* Trend lines comparing gender and education
* Bar plots showing institution-wise adaptability

## 📦 How to Run This Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Students-Adaptability-EDA.git
   ```
2. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python eda_script.py
   ```

   OR open the notebook (`.ipynb`) in Jupyter.

---

## 📈 Insights & Learnings

* Students with higher education levels tend to show higher adaptability.
* Financial condition influences how students adapt to learning modes.
* Gender-wise distribution reveals age-based behavior patterns.
* Government vs. non-government institution type impacts adaptivity levels.

This project helped build strong fundamentals in **data preprocessing, visualization, and identifying insights**.
